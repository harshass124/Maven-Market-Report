### Problem
Maven Market faced challenges in tracking and analyzing its sales performance across various brands and geographical regions.
The existing methods for monitoring sales metrics and return rates were fragmented, making it difficult for the management team to 
make data-driven decisions. There was a need for a consolidated view to monitor sales trends, evaluate brand performance, and set
realistic targets to optimize business operations.

### Key Metrics
## Current Month Transaction

- Displays the number of transactions for the current month.
- Includes a comparison to the monthly goal, highlighting the percentage variance.
  
## Current Month Revenue

- Shows the total revenue generated for the current month.
- Includes a goal comparison to track progress towards the monthly target.
  
## Current Month Return

- Indicates the number of product returns recorded for the current month.
- Compares with the set goal to manage return rates effectively.

  
### Features
## Product Brand Performance

## Weekly Revenue Trending
